MiniPascal Compiler

This app will take in user provided pascal code and convert it into a MIPS assembly language.
Command Line prompt must be used to run the app. 

Instructions.
1. Open cmd from system menu
2. navigate to the directory, where the MiniPascalCompiler.jar resides.(cd <parth to the directory/>
3. Tyep: "java -jar MiniPascal.jar <path to the pascal code.pas>" and click enter

Errors
When pascal code is not valid code we may find error messages 
   Error Example
	- "Expected token-> BEGIN : found SEMICOLON instead at line 1 column 35"
		this error message is a syntax error 
		indicating the line and column number to look into debuging


There should be two new ?les residing int the directory where MiniPascalCompiler.jar exists
   <pascal input filename.asm> : the compiled assembly code in MIPS assembly istruction
   <pascal input filename.table> :the table of symbols from the pascal code

NOTE to user:
-In its current shape the file will not handle some important data types such as arrays and floating numbers
-In addition there are some major bugs which will be fixed in next release (prob with parser)
	-> this will serve as demonstration in the meantime
